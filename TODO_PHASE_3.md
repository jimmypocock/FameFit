**Status**: Complete (2025-07-20) ✅  
**Duration**: 3-4 weeks  
**Priority**: Critical - Core social experience

## Overview

Phase 3 implemented a comprehensive social following system with CloudKit integration, enabling users to build their fitness community through following relationships, discovery, and privacy-aware content sharing.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Create comprehensive social following service with CloudKit integration
- [x] Implement rate limiting and anti-spam security measures
- [x] Build user search and discovery functionality
- [x] Create followers/following list views with search
- [x] Implement social feed with content filtering

- [x] Create mock services for testing isolation
- [x] Implement privacy controls and relationship management
- [x] Add security documentation and best practices
- [x] Complete workout feed integration with privacy controls

## Workout Feed Integration & Privacy Controls ✅

### Phase 3.1: User Privacy Settings ✅

- [x] Created WorkoutPrivacySettings model with:
  - Default privacy levels (Private, Friends Only, Public)
  - Per-workout type privacy overrides
  - COPPA compliance for users under 13
  - Data sharing preferences
- [x] Comprehensive privacy validation and enforcement
- [x] Privacy settings ready for CloudKit integration

### Phase 3.2: Workout Activity Feed Integration ✅

- [x] Created ActivityFeedService for posting workout activities
- [x] Integrated with WorkoutObserver for workout completion events
- [x] Added beautiful post-workout sharing prompt (WorkoutSharingPromptView)
- [x] Implemented privacy level selector in sharing UI
- [x] Added "Include workout details" toggle

### Phase 3.3: Feed Privacy Enforcement ✅

- [x] Updated SocialFeedViewModel to use ActivityFeedService
- [x] Implemented privacy-aware activity filtering
- [x] Added feed filtering UI with privacy controls
- [x] Created comprehensive test coverage for all components
- [x] Updated QA documentation with testing procedures

### Privacy Levels

- **Private**: Only visible to user (default)
- **Friends Only**: Visible to mutual followers only
- **Public**: Visible to all followers and in discovery

### User Experience

1. **First-time setup**: Onboarding explains privacy options, defaults to private
2. **Post-workout**: "Share this workout?" prompt with privacy selector
3. **Settings**: Granular controls per workout type
4. **Feed**: Clear privacy indicators and user controls

### Security Considerations

- Privacy settings stored in private CloudKit database
- Server-side privacy enforcement for all feed queries
- Audit trail for privacy setting changes
- No personal data in public activities without explicit consent
- COPPA compliance: Under-13 accounts cannot share publicly

## Week 1: CloudKit Infrastructure & Security ✅

### Secure Schema Design

```
UserRelationship (Public Database)
- relationshipId: String (CKRecord.ID = "\(followerID)_follows_\(followingID)")
- followerID: String (Reference) - QUERYABLE, SORTABLE
- followingID: String (Reference) - QUERYABLE, SORTABLE
- status: String ("active", "blocked", "muted") - QUERYABLE
- notificationsEnabled: Int64
- Uses system fields: createdTimestamp, modificationTimestamp

FollowRequest (Private Database) - For private profiles
- requestId: String (CKRecord.ID)
- requesterId: String - QUERYABLE
- targetId: String - QUERYABLE
- status: String ("pending", "accepted", "rejected")
- createdAt: Date - QUERYABLE
- message: String (optional)
```

### Required Indexes
- followerID (QUERYABLE, SORTABLE)
- followingID (QUERYABLE, SORTABLE)
- status (QUERYABLE)
- ___recordID (QUERYABLE) - Critical system index

### Core Following Service

**SocialFollowingService Protocol**
```swift
protocol SocialFollowingServicing {
    func follow(userId: String) async throws
    func unfollow(userId: String) async throws
    func getFollowers(for userId: String) async throws -> [UserProfile]
    func getFollowing(for userId: String) async throws -> [UserProfile]
    func checkRelationship(between: String, and: String) async throws -> RelationshipStatus
    func blockUser(_ userId: String) async throws
    func muteUser(_ userId: String) async throws
}
```

### Security Implementation
- Rate limiting: Max 60 follow actions per hour
- Duplicate prevention: Check existing relationships
- Privacy enforcement: Respect user privacy settings
- Age verification: No following for users under 13
- Spam detection: Pattern analysis for bot behavior

### Anti-Abuse Systems

**Rate Limiting Service**
```swift
class RateLimiter {
    private var actionHistory: [String: [Date]] = [:]
    private let limits: [ActionType: RateLimit]
    
    func checkLimit(for action: ActionType, userId: String) throws
    func recordAction(_ action: ActionType, userId: String)
    func resetLimits(for userId: String)
}
```

**Content Filtering**
- Profanity filter for usernames/bios
- Image moderation API integration
- ML-based spam detection
- Report queue management

## Week 2: User Discovery & Privacy ✅

### Secure Search Implementation

**UserSearchService**
- Username search with privacy filtering
- Fuzzy matching with typo tolerance
- Search result ranking algorithm
- Recent searches (private storage)
- Search history encryption

**Privacy Controls**
- Hide from search option
- Approved followers only mode
- Block list enforcement
- Geographic restrictions (GDPR)

### Discovery Algorithm

**Suggested Users Engine**
- Common workout patterns matching
- Similar fitness levels (XP-based)
- Geographic proximity (optional)
- Mutual connections analysis
- New user recommendations

**Security Measures**
- No location tracking without consent
- Anonymous analytics only
- Opt-out mechanisms
- Data minimization

### Secure Leaderboard System

```swift
protocol ActivityFeedProviding {
    func getFeed(for userId: String, page: Int) async throws -> [FeedItem]
    func refreshFeed(for userId: String) async throws
    func markAsRead(itemIds: [String]) async throws
}
```
