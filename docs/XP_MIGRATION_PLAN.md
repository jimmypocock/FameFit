# XP System Migration - COMPLETED

## Overview
This migration has been completed. FameFit now uses an XP-based gamification system instead of the legacy follower system.

## Current System
- **totalXP**: The primary field for tracking user experience points
- **xpEarned**: Field on workouts tracking XP earned per workout
- All legacy "follower" and "influencerXP" references have been removed from the codebase

## XP Calculation
XP is calculated based on:
- Workout duration and type
- Intensity (heart rate zones)
- Consistency bonuses (streaks)
- Time of day bonuses
- Special achievements and milestones

See `XPCalculator.swift` for implementation details.

## Archived Migration Notes
The original migration from followers → influencerXP → totalXP has been completed and all legacy fields have been removed from the application code.
