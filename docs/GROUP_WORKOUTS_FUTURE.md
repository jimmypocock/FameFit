# Group Workouts - Future Enhancements

This document outlines planned future enhancements for the group workout feature that were identified during initial implementation.

## Phase 2 Features

### Privacy & Sharing Controls
- **Granular sharing settings** - Let users choose which metrics to share with the group
  - Options: All metrics, Only calories, Only duration, Anonymous mode
  - Per-workout or default settings
  - Hide specific metrics (e.g., heart rate for privacy)

- **Anonymous mode** - Option to participate without sharing personal metrics
  - Show as "Anonymous Participant" in leaderboard
  - Still track personal data locally
  - Count towards group totals without individual attribution

### Advanced Host Management
- **Host leaves early** - Transfer host role or auto-complete workout
  - Automatic host transfer to longest-participating member
  - Option to designate co-hosts before workout starts
  - Graceful workout completion if host disconnects

### Mixed Workout Support
- **Different workout types** - Participants doing different activities
  - Host runs while participants do yoga/cycling/etc
  - Normalized scoring based on effort/heart rate zones
  - Activity-specific leaderboards

### Social Features
- **Achievement notifications** - Real-time celebration messages
  - "John just hit 500 calories! üî•"
  - "Sarah reached 5km! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
  - "Group milestone: 10,000 total calories!"
  - Customizable notification preferences

## Phase 3 Features

### Enhanced Analytics
- Post-workout insights and trends
- Personal best tracking within group workouts
- Effort zones comparison
- Weekly/monthly group workout summaries

### Scheduling Improvements

   - Advanced gamification

## Notes

- All features should maintain the current architecture patterns
- Privacy and security should be paramount in all features
- Performance impact should be measured before releasing new features
- User feedback should guide feature prioritization
