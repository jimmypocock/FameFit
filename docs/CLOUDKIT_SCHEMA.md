# CloudKit Schema Documentation

This document defines all CloudKit record types and their fields used in FameFit.

## Important Notes

1. **System Fields**: CloudKit automatically provides these fields on every record:
   - `recordName` (String) - Unique identifier
   - `creationDate` (Date) - When the record was created
   - `modificationDate` (Date) - When the record was last modified
   - `recordChangeTag` (String) - Used for conflict resolution
   
2. **Queryable Fields**: Only system fields (`creationDate`, `modificationDate`) are queryable by default. Custom fields must be manually marked as queryable in CloudKit Dashboard.

3. **Sortable Fields**: Only queryable fields can be used in sort descriptors.

4. **CRITICAL - recordID Index**: When creating any new record type that will be queried with `NSPredicate(value: true)` or similar queries, you MUST add `___recordID` as a QUERYABLE index in CloudKit Dashboard. This prevents the "Field 'recordName' is not marked queryable" error.

## Database Overview

FameFit uses multiple CloudKit databases:
- **Private Database**: Personal data, settings, workout history
- **Public Database**: User profiles, leaderboards, discoverable content
- **Shared Database**: (Future) Friend connections, group challenges

### Data Architecture Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**: User statistics (XP, workout count, etc.) are stored ONLY in the private `Users` table
2. **Public Cache**: The `UserProfiles` table in the public database contains cached copies for social features
3. **One-way Sync**: Data flows from Users â†’ UserProfiles, never the reverse
4. **Privacy First**: Only data explicitly marked as public is synced to the public database

## Record Types

### Private Database

#### Users
Stores user profile information.

| Field | Type | Required | Queryable | Indexed | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| displayName | String | Yes | Yes | No | Display name |
| influencerXP | Int64 | Yes* | Yes | Yes | DEPRECATED - Use totalXP |
| totalXP | Int64 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Total XP earned (source of truth) |
| totalWorkouts | Int64 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Total workouts completed (source of truth) |
| currentStreak | Int64 | Yes | Yes | No | Current workout streak |
| lastWorkoutTimestamp | Date | No | Yes | No | Last workout date |
| joinTimestamp | Date | Yes | Yes | No | When user joined |

*Note: This is the source of truth for all user statistics. The public UserProfiles table contains cached copies of these values.*

**Migration Note**: The `influencerXP` field is deprecated but kept for backward compatibility. The app writes to both `influencerXP` and `totalXP` fields but reads preferentially from `totalXP`.

## CloudKit Dashboard Setup

To avoid runtime errors, configure the following in CloudKit Dashboard:

1. **Create Record Types**:
   - Go to CloudKit Dashboard > Schema > Record Types
   - Create all record types as defined above:
     - Private Database: `Users`, `WorkoutHistory`, `UserSettings`, `FollowRequests`, `DeviceTokens`
     - Public Database: `UserProfiles`, `UserRelationships`, `ActivityFeedItems`, `WorkoutKudos`, `WorkoutComments`, `WorkoutChallenges`, `GroupWorkouts`
   - Add all custom fields as defined above

2. **Configure Indexes**:
   - For queries that need custom sorting, mark fields as queryable
   - **REQUIRED**: Add `___recordID` as QUERYABLE index for each record type
   - For WorkoutHistory: Also mark `endDate` and `startDate` as QUERYABLE + SORTABLE

3. **Deploy to Production**:
   - After testing in development, deploy schema to production
   - Schema changes are not automatic between environments

## Best Practices

1. **Use CKQueryOperation instead of convenience methods** when you need more control or encounter queryable field errors
2. **Avoid complex predicates** - Use `NSPredicate(value: true)` to fetch all records and filter in memory
3. **Never use sort descriptors in queries** - Sort in memory after fetching to avoid queryable field errors
4. **Always handle missing record types gracefully** - Check for specific CKError codes
5. **Test in development** environment first before deploying to production
6. **For simple fetches**, consider using record IDs or zones instead of queries

## Field Migration Strategy

Since CloudKit doesn't support renaming fields, here's how to handle field migrations:

1. **Add the new field** (e.g., `totalXP`) in CloudKit Dashboard
2. **Keep the old field** (e.g., `influencerXP`) for backward compatibility
3. **Update code to write to both fields** during transition
4. **Read preferentially from the new field** with fallback to old field
5. **After all users update**, you can stop writing to the old field

Example in code:
```swift
// Writing - update both fields
userRecord["totalXP"] = newValue
userRecord["influencerXP"] = newValue // Backward compatibility

// Reading - try new field first
let xp = record["totalXP"] as? Int ?? record["influencerXP"] as? Int ?? 0
```

## Common Errors and Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Field 'recordName' is not marked queryable" | Missing recordID index | Add `___recordID` as QUERYABLE index in CloudKit Dashboard |
| "Field X is not marked queryable" | Using non-queryable field in predicate or sort | Use system fields or mark field queryable in dashboard |
| "Did not find record type X" | Record type doesn't exist | Save a record to auto-create type or create in dashboard |
| "Invalid predicate" | Using unsupported query operations | Simplify query or fetch all and filter locally |
