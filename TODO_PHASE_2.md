**Duration**: 2-3 weeks  
**Priority**: High - Foundation for all social features

## Overview

Phase 2 implemented a comprehensive user profile system with CloudKit backend, enabling users to create and manage their fitness identities within the app.

- [x] Implement UserProfileService with CloudKit backend
- [x] Add profile photo upload/compression
- [x] Username uniqueness validation
- [x] Profile caching strategy
- [x] Security and content moderation

## Architecture Design

### CloudKit Database Strategy

- **Private Database**: User preferences, blocked users, private settings
- **Public Database**: Public profiles, discoverable content, leaderboards  
- **Shared Database**: Friend connections, private messages (future)

### Schema Design

```
UserProfile (Public Database)
- userId: String (Queryable, Sortable) - CKRecord.ID
- username: String (Queryable, Sortable) - Unique, 3-30 chars
- displayName: String (Queryable) - 1-50 chars
- bio: String - 0-500 chars
- profileImage: CKAsset - Max 5MB
- headerImage: CKAsset - Optional banner
- workoutCount: Int64 (Queryable, Sortable)
- totalXP: Int64 (Queryable, Sortable)
- joinedDate: Date (Queryable, Sortable)
- lastActive: Date (Queryable, Sortable)
- isVerified: Int64 (Queryable) - Future celebrity accounts
- privacyLevel: String (Queryable) - "public", "friends", "private"

UserSettings (Private Database)
- userId: String (Reference to UserProfile)
- emailNotifications: Int64
- pushNotifications: Int64
- workoutPrivacy: String - "everyone", "friends", "private"
- allowMessages: String - "everyone", "friends", "none"
- blockedUsers: [String] - Array of userIds
- mutedUsers: [String] - Array of userIds
- contentFilter: String - "strict", "moderate", "off"
```

### Required CloudKit Indexes

- `___recordID` - QUERYABLE (prevents query errors)
- username - QUERYABLE, SORTABLE
- totalXP - QUERYABLE, SORTABLE (for leaderboards)
- lastActive - QUERYABLE, SORTABLE (for discovery)

## Implementation Details

### Week 1: Core Infrastructure ✅

**CloudKit Schema Setup**

- Created UserProfile record type in CloudKit Dashboard
- Created UserSettings record type
- Added all required indexes
- Deployed to Development and Production environments
- Documented schema in CLOUDKIT_SCHEMA.md

**Profile Service Layer**

- Created `UserProfileService` protocol with CloudKit abstraction
- Implemented profile CRUD operations
- Added username uniqueness validation
- Implemented profile caching with 15-minute TTL
- Created mock service for testing

**Data Models**

- Created `UserProfile` model with Codable support
- Created `UserSettings` model
- Added validation logic for all fields
- Implemented privacy level enums
- Created comprehensive unit tests

### Week 2: User Interface ✅

**Profile Creation Flow**

- Designed onboarding extension for profile setup
- Username selection with real-time validation
- Display name and bio input screens
- Profile photo picker with crop functionality
- Privacy settings selection

**Profile Views**

- Created `ProfileView` for viewing profiles
- Implemented `EditProfileView` with all fields
- Added profile photo upload with compression
- Created loading and error states
- Implemented pull-to-refresh

**Integration**

- Updated MainView to show user profile
- Added profile navigation from workout history
- Integrated with existing XP system
- Updated onboarding flow

### Week 3: Security & Polish ✅

**Content Moderation**

- Implemented profanity filter for usernames/bios
- Added reporting mechanism for profiles
- Created moderation queue (admin feature)
- Documented moderation policies

**Privacy & Compliance**

- Implemented GDPR data export
- Added account deletion with data cleanup
- Created age verification for COPPA
- Added privacy policy updates

**Testing & Documentation**

- Comprehensive unit tests (>80% coverage)
- UI tests for all flows
- Performance testing with 1000+ profiles
- Updated user documentation

## Security Implementation Details

### Content Moderation Strategy

1. **Client-side filtering**: Basic profanity filter using word list
2. **Server-side validation**: CloudKit Web Services for advanced checks
3. **Reporting system**: Users can report inappropriate content
4. **Moderation queue**: Admin review for reported content
5. **Automated actions**: Temporary hiding of reported content

### Privacy Controls

- Three-tier privacy: Public, Friends Only, Private
- Granular controls for each data type
- Blocked users cannot view any content
- Data minimization principles applied

### COPPA Compliance

- Age gate during onboarding
- Parental consent flow for under-13
- Limited features for child accounts
- No public profiles for minors

### GDPR Compliance

- Data portability via export function
- Right to erasure (account deletion)
- Clear consent mechanisms
- Privacy by design principles

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimizations

- Implement profile caching with TTL
- Lazy load profile images
- Batch fetch for leaderboards
- Optimize CloudKit queries with proper indexes

### Error Handling

- Network failure resilience
- Conflict resolution for username claims
- Graceful degradation for missing data
- User-friendly error messages

### Testing Strategy

- Mock CloudKit for unit tests
- UI tests with deterministic data
- Performance benchmarks
- Security penetration testing

## Success Metrics Achieved

- Profile creation completion rate > 80% ✅
- Username validation < 500ms ✅
- Profile load time < 1s ✅
- Zero security incidents ✅
- COPPA/GDPR compliant ✅

## Dependencies

- CloudKit schema must be deployed first ✅
- Requires iOS 17.0+ for latest CloudKit features ✅
- Profile images need CloudKit asset storage ✅
- Username validation needs network connectivity ✅

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: Username squatting  
**Mitigation**: Inactive account policy, verification for brands

**Risk**: Inappropriate content  
**Mitigation**: Multi-layer moderation, quick response team

**Risk**: Performance at scale  
**Mitigation**: Caching strategy, CloudKit optimization

**Risk**: Privacy breaches  
**Mitigation**: Minimal data collection, encryption, audits

- Personal branding within the fitness community
- Social discovery and connections
- Privacy-first profile management
- Foundation for all future social features

This phase directly enabled Phase 3 (Social Following) and beyond.
