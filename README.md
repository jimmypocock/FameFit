# FameFit - Your Personal Celebrity Fitness Influencer ðŸ’ªðŸŒŸ

**The fitness app where your coach thinks they're famous (and makes you famous too)**

A snarky Apple Watch workout app that combines real fitness tracking with an autonomous fitness influencer personality. Imagine having a stereotypical gym bro trapped in your watch, taking credit for your gains while somehow actually motivating you. It tracks your runs, bike rides, walks, HIIT, and weight lifting while delivering brutally honest (and hilarious) motivational messages.

## Current State

This is currently a fully functional Apple Watch workout app that tracks your runs, bike rides, walks, HIIT, and weight lifting while delivering brutally honest (and hilarious) motivational messages.

**ðŸŽ¯ Coming Soon**: iOS companion app for detailed progress tracking, widgets, and sharing your journey to fame!

### Key Features

- **Real Workout Tracking**: Full HealthKit integration for legitimate fitness tracking
- **Savage Motivational Messages**: Over 170+ snarky messages to keep you entertained and motivated
- **Achievement System**: Unlock roast-worthy achievements like "Speed Demon" (for going fast) or "Slow & Steady" (for... not)
- **Live Metrics**: Real-time heart rate, calories, distance, and elapsed time
- **Personality**: Messages appear during workouts, at milestones, and when you complete (or quit) your session

- Custom workout types
- Message personalization based on performance
- Workout history with roast recaps
- Apple Watch complications
