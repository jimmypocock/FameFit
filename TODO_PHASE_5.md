   - Quick schedule options (tomorrow morning, this weekend, etc.)
   
2. **Participant Management**
   - Public workouts: Unlimited participants
   - Friends-only: Visible to followers only
   - Invite-only: Requires invitation (min 1 friend)
   - RSVP system:
     - Yes (committed)
     - Maybe (interested)
     - No (declined)
     - Auto-accept for creator
   - Participant limits with waitlist
   - Real-time participant count updates

     - New participant joined
     - Friend RSVP'd
     - Workout cancelled/rescheduled
   - Smart notifications (respect quiet hours)

#### Technical Implementation

**Service Layer**:
```swift
protocol GroupWorkoutSchedulingService {
    // CRUD Operations
    func createGroupWorkout(_ workout: GroupWorkout) async throws -> GroupWorkout
    func updateGroupWorkout(_ workout: GroupWorkout) async throws
    func cancelGroupWorkout(_ workoutId: String) async throws
    func getGroupWorkout(_ workoutId: String) async throws -> GroupWorkout
    func deleteGroupWorkout(_ workoutId: String) async throws
    
    // Discovery
    func getUpcomingPublicWorkouts(limit: Int) async throws -> [GroupWorkout]
    func getUpcomingFriendsWorkouts(limit: Int) async throws -> [GroupWorkout]
    func getMyScheduledWorkouts() async throws -> [GroupWorkout]
    func searchWorkouts(query: String, filters: WorkoutFilters) async throws -> [GroupWorkout]
    func getWorkoutsByTags(_ tags: [String]) async throws -> [GroupWorkout]
    
    // Participation
    func joinWorkout(_ workoutId: String) async throws
    func leaveWorkout(_ workoutId: String) async throws
    func updateRSVP(_ workoutId: String, status: RSVPStatus) async throws
    func getParticipants(_ workoutId: String) async throws -> [GroupWorkoutParticipant]
    
    // Invitations
    func inviteUsers(_ userIds: [String], to workoutId: String) async throws
    func respondToInvite(_ inviteId: String, accept: Bool) async throws
    func getMyInvites() async throws -> [GroupWorkoutInvite]
    
    // Recurring Workouts
    func createRecurringWorkout(_ template: GroupWorkout, pattern: RecurringPattern) async throws
    func updateRecurringSeries(_ workoutId: String, updates: GroupWorkout) async throws
    func deleteRecurringSeries(_ workoutId: String) async throws
}
```

**Key Implementation Details**:

1. **Timezone Handling**:
   - Store all dates in UTC in CloudKit
   - Store timezone identifier with workout
   - Convert to user's local timezone for display
   - Handle daylight saving transitions
   - Show timezone in UI when different from user's

2. **Real-time Updates**:
   - CloudKit subscriptions for participant changes
   - Push notifications for important updates
   - Optimistic UI updates with rollback

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Cache upcoming workouts locally
   - Paginate discovery results
   - Prefetch participant details
   - Batch invitation sending

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Creator cancellation
   - Participant limit reached
   - Time conflicts detection
   - Past workout handling
   - Network failure recovery

5. **Security & Privacy**:
   - Respect user privacy settings
   - Validate participant limits
   - Prevent spam invitations
   - Rate limit workout creation
   - Block/mute user support

### üè∑Ô∏è Tag System Functionality (Future Enhancement)

**Priority**: Medium - Improves workout discovery
**Impact**: High - Better user experience and community building

**Core Tag Features**:
1. **Discovery & Search**
   - Filter group workouts by tags in discovery feed
   - Search for workouts with specific tags ("#HIIT", "#Beginner")
   - Auto-suggest popular tags during workout creation
   - Trending tags dashboard
   
2. **Categorization System**
   - **Difficulty**: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert
   - **Location**: Indoor, Outdoor, Gym, Home, Pool, Track
   - **Style**: HIIT, Cardio, Strength, Endurance, Flexibility, Recovery
   - **Equipment**: Bodyweight, Dumbbells, Resistance Bands, Treadmill
   - **Time**: QuickWorkout, Marathon, Lunch Break
   
3. **Personalized Recommendations**
   - Suggest workouts based on user's preferred tags
   - "More like this" recommendations using tag similarity
   - Personalized discovery algorithm incorporating tag preferences
   - Save favorite tags for quick filtering
   
4. **Community Building**
   - Track popular workout types/tags in community
   - Help users find their fitness tribe (yoga lovers, runners, strength enthusiasts)
   - Tag-based workout challenges and events
   - Leaderboards by tag category
   
5. **Analytics & Insights**
   - User engagement metrics by tag
   - Popular tag combinations
   - Seasonal tag trends
   - Geographic tag preferences

**Implementation Priority**:
- Phase 1: Tag-based filtering and search
- Phase 2: Recommendation engine
- Phase 3: Analytics and community features
   
4. **Notifications**
   - Reminder 1 hour before scheduled time
   - Participant join notifications
   - Schedule change alerts
   - Auto-cancel if creator doesn't join
   
**Note**: Tags are currently implemented in UI but lack functional purpose. They're stored in CloudKit and displayed as purple pills in workout cards, but don't yet power discovery, search, or recommendations.

**Future Enhancement - Background Workout Processing**:
- **Problem**: Auto-sharing only works when app is open
- **Current Behavior**: 
  - Workouts completed while app is closed aren't shared until next app launch
  - WorkoutSyncManager catches up on missed workouts during initial sync
- **Proposed Solutions**:
  1. **HealthKit Background Delivery** (Recommended)
     - Register for background workout updates
     - App wakes periodically to process new workouts
     - Most battery-efficient approach
  2. **Silent Push from Watch App**
     - Watch app sends push when workout completes
     - Requires server infrastructure
  3. **Background App Refresh**
     - iOS wakes app periodically
     - Less reliable timing
- **Implementation Requirements**:
  - Add Background Modes capability
  - Register for HKObserverQuery with background delivery
  - Handle background processing limits
  - Test battery impact
