# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

While this is a fitness motivation app with no sensitive user data handling, we still take security seriously.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Instead, please report it privately by:
   - Opening a private security advisory on GitHub
   - Or emailing the repository owner directly

## What We Consider Security Issues

- Potential for code injection
- HealthKit data exposure beyond intended scope
- Any vulnerability that could compromise user privacy
- Issues that could affect Apple Watch system stability

## What's NOT a Security Issue

- The app hurting your feelings (that's a feature)
- Motivational messages being too harsh
- UI/UX complaints
- Feature requests

## Response Timeline

- Acknowledgment: Within 48 hours
- Initial assessment: Within 1 week
- Resolution timeline: Depends on severity

## Disclosure Policy

- Security issues will be fixed before public disclosure
- Credit will be given to reporters (unless requested otherwise)
- We'll coordinate disclosure timing with reporters

Thank you for helping keep our sarcastic fitness app secure!
