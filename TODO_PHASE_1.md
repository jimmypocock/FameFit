# FameFit Phase 1: Influencer XP System ✅

**Status**: Completed (2025-07-18) ✅  
**Impact**: High - Major feature addition transforming app dynamics

Transform the current "followers" system into a comprehensive gamification and social networking platform.

## Core Concept Changes

**From**: Followers (simple counter)  
**To**: Influencer XP (experience points) + Real Social Following

This creates a dual-currency system:

- **Influencer XP**: Earned through workouts, used for in-app rewards/features
- **Real Followers**: Actual users who follow your fitness journey

## Phase 1: Influencer XP System (Foundation) ✅

**Completed Tasks**:

- [x] Rename "followers" to "Influencer XP" throughout codebase
  - [x] Update CloudKit schema (maintain backward compatibility)
  - [x] Create migration for existing users (server-side tool)
  - [x] Update UI labels and terminology
  - [x] Update achievement messages and thresholds
- [x] Create XP calculation engine
  - [x] Base XP for workout completion
  - [x] Bonus XP for workout type/intensity
  - [x] Streak multipliers
  - [x] Time-of-day bonuses
  - [x] Achievement-based XP boosts
- [x] Implement XP unlock system (XP unlocks rewards, not spent)
  - [x] Design achievement-based unlocks (in XPCalculator)
  - [x] Create unlockable rewards catalog (in XPCalculator)
  - [x] Progress tracking UI component
  - [x] Unlock notification system
  - [x] Unlock persistence/storage

## Security Requirements

- Server-side XP validation (prevent client manipulation)
- Rate limiting for XP gains
- Audit trail for all XP transactions
- Encrypted storage of XP balances
