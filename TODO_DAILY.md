### Completion Summary

**What was done:**
1. ✅ Renamed ImprovedSocialFollowingService to CachedSocialFollowingService (better naming)
2. ✅ Integrated CachedSocialFollowingService into DependencyContainer
3. ✅ Implemented proper caching with TTL:
   - Profile cache: 5 minutes

6. ✅ Created comprehensive test suite
7. ✅ Removed old buggy SocialFollowingService

**Result:** The follower/following system now properly handles IDs and caches data for better performance.

### The Problem (Historical Reference)

The follower/following system has two major issues:

1. **ID Confusion**: The app uses two different ID types inconsistently:
   - **Profile UUID**: The CloudKit record ID for UserProfile (e.g., `6F835AC7-8100-4B8B-95F5-94AB7F431AA0`)
   - **CloudKit User ID**: The actual user identifier (e.g., `_65016d98fd8579ab704d38d23d066b2f`)

2. **Broken Caching**: The caching system has multiple issues:
   - No cache invalidation when relationships change
   - Optimistic updates that don't reflect server state
   - ID confusion in cache keys (mixing profile UUIDs and user IDs)
   - No expiration or TTL for cached data
   - Lists (followers/following) aren't cached at all

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Standardize on CloudKit User IDs (Week 1)

**Day 1-2: Audit & Document**

- [ ] Create comprehensive audit document of all ID usage
- [ ] Identify all places using profile.id vs profile.userID
- [ ] Document data flow from UI → Service → CloudKit
- [ ] Create migration plan for existing code

**Day 3-4: Fix Core Services**

- [ ] Update SocialFollowingService to ONLY use CloudKit user IDs
  - [ ] Fix all query predicates to use userID

  ```swift
  struct CacheEntry<T> {
      let value: T
      let timestamp: Date
      let ttl: TimeInterval
      
      var isExpired: Bool {

      duration: TimeInterval,
      // Never pass HR, calories, etc.
  ) -> String {
      switch workoutType {
      case "High Intensity Interval Training", "CrossFit":
          return "vigorous"
      case "Yoga", "Walking", "Cooldown":
          return "light"
      case "Running", "Cycling":
          // Use duration as proxy for intensity
          if duration > 3600 { // >1 hour
              return "vigorous"
          } else if duration > 1800 { // >30 min
              return "moderate"
          } else {
              return "light"
          }
      default:
