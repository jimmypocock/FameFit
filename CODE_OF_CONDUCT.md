# Code of Conduct

## The Golden Rule

Be excellent to each other. The app roasts users, not contributors.

## Expected Behavior

- 💪 **Be supportive**: Help others learn from the code
- 🤝 **Be respectful**: Disagree professionally
- 🎯 **Be constructive**: Focus on improving the project
- 😄 **Have humor**: Appreciate the app's personality without being mean to people

## Unacceptable Behavior

- 🚫 Personal attacks or harassment
- 🚫 Discriminatory language or actions
- 🚫 Trolling or deliberately inflammatory comments
- 🚫 Spam or off-topic content
- 🚫 Violating the proprietary license

## The Irony

Yes, we know it's ironic that an app designed to roast people has a "be nice" policy. The difference is:
- The app's snark is consensual (users choose to install it)
- The app roasts everyone equally 
- It's all in good fun with the goal of motivation

Contributors, however, should treat each other with respect.

## Enforcement

Violations may result in:
1. Friendly warning
2. Temporary ban from contributing
3. Permanent ban for serious violations

## Reporting

Report issues by opening a GitHub issue with [CONDUCT] in the title.

## Remember

We're all here to create something fun and motivating. Let's keep the savage burns in the app, not in the issues section.
