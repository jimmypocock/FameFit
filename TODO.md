# FameFit Architecture Improvements TODO

This document tracks planned architecture improvements to enhance testability, reduce coupling, and follow modern iOS/Swift best practices.

## üîÑ **NEXT REFACTORING - CloudKit Field Cleanup**

### Remove Redundant Fields from UserProfile

**Analysis Complete**:
- `lastUpdated` field duplicates CloudKit's `record.modificationDate`
- `joinedDate` field duplicates CloudKit's `record.creationDate`

**Action Required**:
1. Remove both fields from UserProfile model
2. Update all code to use CloudKit system fields
3. Migration strategy for existing data
4. Update tests accordingly

**CloudKit Field Deprecation**:
- CloudKit doesn't support marking fields as deprecated in production
- Best practice: Stop writing to old fields, continue reading for compatibility
- After all clients updated, manually remove fields from CloudKit Dashboard
- Document deprecated fields in CLOUDKIT_SCHEMA.md with removal timeline

## üåÖ **MORNING FOCUS - 2025-07-31**

**Note**: Tags are currently implemented in UI but lack functional purpose. They're stored in CloudKit and displayed as purple pills in workout cards, but don't yet power discovery, search, or recommendations.

**Future Enhancement - Background Workout Processing**:
- **Problem**: Auto-sharing only works when app is open
- **Current Behavior**: 
  - Workouts completed while app is closed aren't shared until next app launch
  - WorkoutSyncManager catches up on missed workouts during initial sync
- **Proposed Solutions**:
  1. **HealthKit Background Delivery** (Recommended)
     - Register for background workout updates
     - App wakes periodically to process new workouts
     - Most battery-efficient approach
  2. **Silent Push from Watch App**
     - Watch app sends push when workout completes
     - Requires server infrastructure
  3. **Background App Refresh**
     - iOS wakes app periodically
     - Less reliable timing
- **Implementation Requirements**:
  - Add Background Modes capability
  - Register for HKObserverQuery with background delivery
  - Handle background processing limits
  - Test battery impact

## üö® **CRITICAL: Fix Follower/Following System ID Confusion & Caching**

**Status**: In Progress
**Priority**: CRITICAL - System is currently buggy and unreliable
**Impact**: High - Core social functionality is broken

### The Problem

The follower/following system has two major issues:

1. **ID Confusion**: The app uses two different ID types inconsistently:
   - **Profile UUID**: The CloudKit record ID for UserProfile (e.g., `6F835AC7-8100-4B8B-95F5-94AB7F431AA0`)
   - **CloudKit User ID**: The actual user identifier (e.g., `_65016d98fd8579ab704d38d23d066b2f`)

2. **Broken Caching**: The caching system has multiple issues:
   - No cache invalidation when relationships change
   - Optimistic updates that don't reflect server state
   - ID confusion in cache keys (mixing profile UUIDs and user IDs)
   - No expiration or TTL for cached data
   - Lists (followers/following) aren't cached at all

### Implementation Plan

  - [ ] ProfileView: Accept profile UUID, resolve to userID for social ops
  - [ ] FollowersListView: Use userID for all operations
  - [ ] UserSearchView: Pass profile.id for navigation
  - [ ] TabMainView: Fetch profile first, then navigate with profile.id
- [ ] Add debug logging to verify correct IDs

#### Phase 2: Professional Caching System (Week 1-2)

**Day 1-2: Cache Infrastructure**
- [ ] Create CacheEntry<T> wrapper with expiration
  ```swift
  struct CacheEntry<T> {
      let value: T
      let timestamp: Date
      let ttl: TimeInterval
      
      var isExpired: Bool {
          Date().timeIntervalSince(timestamp) > ttl
      }
  }
  ```

## üîÑ **Medium Priority - After Abstractions**

---

## üìã **Low Priority - Future Work**

### 8. Create Protocol-Based Factory for Dependency Injection

**Impact**: Medium - Better architecture but not critical for current functionality  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Priority**: Low - Post-TestFlight Enhancement

**Current State**: The existing `DependencyContainer` is well-structured with factory methods and protocol-based services. While functional, it could benefit from a more formal factory pattern.

**Proposed Implementation**:
- Create `DependencyFactory` protocol with factory methods for each service type
- Implement `ProductionDependencyFactory` and `TestDependencyFactory` 
- Abstract service creation logic into configurable factories
- Enable easier swapping between production and test implementations
- Improve dependency graph visualization and management

**Rationale for Low Priority**:
- Current DI system works well and is already protocol-based
- High risk/low reward for pre-TestFlight implementation  
- Would require extensive testing across entire app surface area
- Better suited for post-launch architectural improvements
- No current pain points with existing dependency injection

**Timing**: Implement after TestFlight success and user feedback, ideally during next major feature development cycle when significant architectural changes are already planned.

### 9. Abstract HealthKit Session Management

**Impact**: Medium - Direct HealthKit usage in WorkoutManager  
**Status**: Not Started

### 10. Add Logging Protocol  

**Impact**: Low - Current implementation is adequate
