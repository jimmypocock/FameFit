- [x] Verified all unit tests compile and pass (iOS: 146 tests ‚úÖ, Watch: 79 tests ‚úÖ)
- [x] Documented remaining test limitations and expected failures in TESTING_LIMITATIONS.md
- [x] Ensured UI tests work reliably with HealthKit permission dialogs

### 8. ‚úÖ Fix Test Compilation Issues (Technical Debt)

**Status**: Completed (2025-07-16) ‚ú®  
**Impact**: Medium - Clean up test suite

Fixed compilation errors in test suite and documented Apple API limitations.

**Completed Tasks:**

- [x] Fixed MainViewTests compilation errors (duplicate methods, property name mismatches)
- [x] Fixed WorkoutSyncQueueTests compilation errors (missing test helper methods)
- [x] Documented Apple API limitations for deprecated HKWorkout in docs/TESTING_LIMITATIONS.md
- [x] Verified all test files compile successfully
- [x] Added comprehensive documentation explaining why deprecated HKWorkout API is required for testing

## üîÑ **Medium Priority - After Abstractions**

---

## üìã **Low Priority - Future Work**

### 8. Abstract HealthKit Session Management

**Impact**: Medium - Direct HealthKit usage in WorkoutManager  
**Status**: Not Started

### 9. Add Logging Protocol  

**Impact**: Low - Current implementation is adequate  
**Status**: Not Started

### 10. Abstract Complication Data Provider

**Impact**: Low - Watch-specific, limited testing needs  
**Status**: Not Started

### 11. Protocol for Dependency Container

**Impact**: Low - Current implementation works well  
**Status**: Not Started

---

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED - Major Wins!**

**Impact**: Critical for Watch app testability

- [x] Created `WorkoutManaging` protocol with all public properties/methods
- [x] Made `WorkoutManager` conform to the protocol
- [x] Updated all views to use the protocol type instead of concrete type
- [x] Created `MockWorkoutManager` for testing
- [x] Added comprehensive unit tests for Watch app views

### 2. ‚úÖ NotificationStore Protocol (iOS App)  

**Status**: Completed (2025-07-16) ‚ú®  
**Impact**: High - Used throughout the app

- [x] Created `NotificationStoring` protocol
- [x] Made `NotificationStore` conform to the protocol
- [x] Updated all consumers to use the protocol
- [x] Created `MockNotificationStore` for testing
- [x] Fixed notification limiting bug (properly keeps 50 most recent)

### 3. ‚úÖ AchievementManager Protocol (Watch App)

**Status**: Completed (2025-07-16) ‚ú®  
**Impact**: High - Removed UserDefaults coupling

- [x] Created `AchievementManaging` protocol with associated type
- [x] Created `AchievementPersisting` protocol for storage abstraction
- [x] Refactored `AchievementManager` to use dependency injection
- [x] Created mock implementations for testing
- [x] Added comprehensive achievement tests

### 4. ‚úÖ View Model Pattern (MainView)

**Status**: Completed (2025-07-16) ‚ú®  
**Impact**: High - Better separation of concerns

- [x] Created `MainViewModeling` protocol
- [x] Implemented `MainViewModel` with protocol-based dependencies
- [x] Updated `MainView` to use view model pattern
- [x] Created `MockMainViewModel` for testing
- [x] Identified reactive binding limitation with protocols

### 5. ‚úÖ Publisher Support for Manager Protocols

**Status**: Completed (2025-07-16) ‚ú®  
**Impact**: Critical - Enables reactive UI updates through protocols

- [x] Added publisher properties to CloudKitManaging protocol
- [x] Added publisher properties to AuthenticationManaging protocol
- [x] Added publisher properties to NotificationStoring protocol
- [x] Updated CloudKitManager to expose publishers using AnyPublisher
- [x] Updated AuthenticationManager to expose publishers
- [x] Modified MainViewModel to use protocol-based reactive binding
- [x] Created comprehensive reactive view model tests
- [x] Fixed mock implementations to support publishers

### 6. ‚úÖ Abstract WorkoutSyncQueue

**Status**: Completed (2025-07-16) ‚ú®

## üèÜ **What We've Achieved**

The app architecture has been **dramatically improved**:

‚úÖ **Protocol-Oriented Design**: Major components now use protocols instead of concrete dependencies  
‚úÖ **Better Testability**: Comprehensive mocking capabilities for all core services  
‚úÖ **Reduced Coupling**: Clean separation between interfaces and implementations  
‚úÖ **Modern Swift Practices**: Dependency injection throughout the codebase  
‚úÖ **Maintainable Code**: Clear interfaces make future changes much easier

**The foundation is now solid for scalable, testable iOS development!** üöÄ
