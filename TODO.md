- **Public Database**: Public profiles, discoverable content, leaderboards  
- **Shared Database**: Friend connections, private messages (future)

**Schema Design**:
```
UserProfile (Public Database)
- userId: String (Queryable, Sortable) - CKRecord.ID
- username: String (Queryable, Sortable) - Unique, 3-30 chars
- displayName: String (Queryable) - 1-50 chars
- bio: String - 0-500 chars
- profileImage: CKAsset - Max 5MB
- headerImage: CKAsset - Optional banner
- workoutCount: Int64 (Queryable, Sortable)
- totalXP: Int64 (Queryable, Sortable)
- joinedDate: Date (Queryable, Sortable)
- lastActive: Date (Queryable, Sortable)
- isVerified: Int64 (Queryable) - Future celebrity accounts
- privacyLevel: String (Queryable) - "public", "friends", "private"

UserSettings (Private Database)
- userId: String (Reference to UserProfile)
- emailNotifications: Int64
- pushNotifications: Int64
- workoutPrivacy: String - "everyone", "friends", "private"
- allowMessages: String - "everyone", "friends", "none"
- blockedUsers: [String] - Array of userIds
- mutedUsers: [String] - Array of userIds
- contentFilter: String - "strict", "moderate", "off"
```

**Required CloudKit Indexes**:
- `___recordID` - QUERYABLE (prevents query errors)
